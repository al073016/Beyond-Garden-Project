# Beyond-Garden-Project
Beyond Garden is an educational Minecraft Bedrock add-on for the NASA Space Apps Challenge. It turns NASA open data into in-game farming choices: pests become crop-attacking entities and seasons become bosses that affect yields. It teaches young players sustainability and precision agriculture with real-world data.
